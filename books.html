              <p>This is the first book I read. Author coves a lot of ground and is personal. Covers many topics in a

                  Automatic Millionaire</a></h2>
              <p class="book-author">David Bach</p>
              <p class="book-edition">Edition: 2016</p>
              <p>This book is mostly great! Making everything automatic when it comes to personal finance is a wonderful
                idea
                and perhaps the only one that will work for most people. Inspires action and makes it simple. Two things
                I
                don't like is the way he breaks down asset allocation which is too complicated for most people. Listen
                to
                the
                other books about asset allocation. One more significant criticsm is that one should live life on both
                sides
                of retirement, saving every cent can be a mistake if it mean missing out on life which is what will
                likely
                happen if you take the latte factor too far. Still a great book. </p>

              <p>Covers some things that aren't often talked about, like picking a bank and how to handle credit card
                customer service reps. If followed, his advice is good, but I feel it misses the point early retirement

              <p class="book-edition">Edition: 2010</p>
              <p>This book will teach you some of the skills needed to unlearn the mindset they teach in public school
                and become a person who knows how to problem solve. Warning: this is not a typical personal finance
                book. It will not teach you to save to consume more, it will teach you to change the way you view the
                world which may be the only way. I cannot reccomend enough. This book is free on audible if you already
                have access to the library of books or at least it was when I got it. Worth a check!</p>

              <p class="book-edition">Edition: 2017</p>
              <p>If you aren't sold on index funds, this book provides a lot of evidence towards their merit. Great book
                for
                those skeptical about index fund investing through ETF's and mutual funds. Great book for all investors,
                but a
                little dry sometimes. Good as a second or third book. Buy used or get the digital and save.</p>
