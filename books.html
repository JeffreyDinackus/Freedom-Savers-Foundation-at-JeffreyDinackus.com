        <h2 class="book-title">The Simple Path to Wealth</h2>
        <p class="book-author">J.L. Collins</p>
        <p class="book-edition">Edition: June 18 2016</p>
        <p>Great first book to read, author is engaging and covers a lot of ground in this book.</p>

        <h2 class="book-title">The Automatic Millionaire</h2>
        <p class="book-author">David Bach</p>
        <p class="book-edition">Edition: 2016</p>
        <p>This book is great! Making everything automatic when it comes to personal finance is a wonderful idea and perhaps the only one that will work for most people. Inspires action and makes it simple. The one thing I don't like is the way he breaks down asset allocation which is too complicated for most people. Listen to the other books about asset allocation, but besides that everything is great.</p>

        <p class="book-author">Rob Berger</p>
        <p class="book-edition">Edition: 2019</p>
        <p>Great first book. But J.L. Collin's book is probably a little better as a first book. The math in this book is very informative about how small differences in savings rates can make a big difference later in life. A must read!</p>

        <h2 class="book-title">The Little Book on Common Sense Investing</h2>
        <p class="book-author">John "Jack" Bogle</p>
        <p class="book-edition">Edition: 2017</p>
        <p>If you aren't sold on index funds, this book provides a lot of evidence towards their merit. Great book for those skeptical about index fund investing through ETF's and mutual funds. Great book for all investors, but a little dry sometimes. Good as a second or third book. </p>

        <p class="book-author">Tyler Larimore, Mel</p>
        <p class="book-edition">Edition: 2014</p>
        <p>Very detailed book, but a little dry. I would not reccomend as a first book, as if you do not know a about personal finance and individual types of investments, you may feel lost as many things are covered quickly.</p>

        <p class="book-author">Rob Roy</p>
        <p class="book-edition">Edition: 2nd</p>
        <p>Dark horse book, reccomended for anyone. Best for the committed serious investor and is mostly a real estate book, not a traditional personal finance book. Buy a used copy on Amazon to save some bucks!</p>
